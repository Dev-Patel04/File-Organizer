# File-Organizer
This script is designed to help you organize files in a directory by moving them into folders based on their file extensions. Each file's extension is used to create a new folder (if it doesn't already exist) within the specified target directory, and then the file is moved into its corresponding folder.
## Features

- **Automated Sorting**: Automatically sorts files into designated folders based on file extensions.
- **Directory Creation**: Dynamically creates new directories for file types not previously encountered.
- **Customizable Paths**: Easily modify source and target directories within the script.
